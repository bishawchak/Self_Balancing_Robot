# ü§ñ Self-Balancing Robot

A two-wheeled **self-balancing robot** designed using the **inverted pendulum model**.  
It uses an **MPU6050** sensor (gyroscope + accelerometer) and a **PID controller** on **Arduino Nano** to keep the robot balanced.  
The robot can be controlled wirelessly via **Bluetooth** using the **EZ-GUI Ground Station** Android app.

## üß† How It Works

The self-balancing robot maintains its upright position by continuously adjusting motor speed based on sensor feedback.  
The **MPU6050 sensor** measures the tilt and angular velocity.  
The **Arduino Nano** runs a **PID control algorithm** to correct any deviation and stabilize the robot.

**Control Flow:**
1. Sensor detects tilt (angle and rate).
2. Arduino calculates correction using PID.
3. Motor driver adjusts wheel torque.
4. Robot returns to balanced position.

## üß© Working Principle

- **MPU6050 Sensor:** Measures tilt and angular velocity.  
- **Arduino Nano:** Processes sensor data and calculates motor control output using the PID formula:  
  \[
  u(t) = K_p e(t) + K_i \int e(t) dt + K_d \frac{de(t)}{dt}
  \]
- **Motors:** Adjust their speed to maintain vertical balance.
- **Bluetooth Module:** Allows remote commands from the Android app.
